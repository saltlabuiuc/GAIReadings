**Summary (3â€“5 sentences):**  
This survey establishes "Context Engineering" as a formal discipline that expands beyond prompt engineering to include the entire lifecycle of designing and optimizing context for LLMs. The paper identifies three foundational componentsâ€”context retrieval and generation, context processing, and context managementâ€”and explores how these are integrated into advanced implementations such as RAG systems, memory-augmented agents, tool-based reasoning, and multi-agent systems. It highlights a critical asymmetry between context understanding and output generation capabilities in current models. Drawing from over 1400 papers, the authors propose a unified taxonomy and outline future challenges and research directions for context-aware AI systems.

**Whatâ€™s novel or useful about this paper?**  
It presents the first comprehensive framework that unifies fragmented research on how LLMs use, manage, and optimize context. It clearly distinguishes between foundational techniques and system-level integrations and defines context engineering as an optimization problem with formal mathematical underpinnings. It also brings attention to a key performance gap in LLMs: their inability to generate outputs as sophisticated as the contexts they can interpret.

**One question youâ€™d ask the authors:**  
How can the principles of context engineering be translated into practical tooling or APIs for everyday developers who aren't LLM researchers?

**Personal Reflection (Optional):**  
This paper clarified how deeply context affects LLM behavior and sparked ideas about how to better design AI assistants that adapt intelligently to dynamic environments.
